# What's this?
This is crate provides very minimal Rust bindings for the `stdtr` and `inc_beta` functions
from the Cephes math library.

# Should I use this?
Probably not. This is an experimental crate that is not pubished on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
I only made these bindings for use with [QuickCheck](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck) to test a pure rust
implementation of these functions.
